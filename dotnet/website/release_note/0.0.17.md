# DevGpt.Net 0.0.17 Release Notes

## 🌟 What's New

1. **.NET Core Target Framework Support** ([#3203](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3203))
   - 🚀 Added support for .NET Core to ensure compatibility and enhanced performance of DevGpt packages across different platforms.

2. **Kernel Support in Interactive Service Constructor** ([#3181](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3181))
   - 🧠 Enhanced the Interactive Service to accept a kernel in its constructor, facilitating usage in notebook environments.

3. **Constructor Options for OpenAIChatAgent** ([#3126](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3126))
   - ⚙️ Added new constructor options for `OpenAIChatAgent` to allow full control over chat completion flags/options.

4. **Step-by-Step Execution for Group Chat** ([#3075](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3075))
   - 🛠️ Introduced an `IAsyncEnumerable` extension API to run group chat step-by-step, enabling developers to observe internal processes or implement early stopping mechanisms.

## 🚀 Improvements

   - 🔄 Added cancellation tokens to async APIs in the `DevGpt.Core.Graph` class to follow best practices and enhance the control flow.

## ⚠️ API Breaking Changes

1. **FunctionDefinition Generation Stopped in Source Generator** ([#3133](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3133))
   - 🛑 Stopped generating `FunctionDefinition` from `Azure.AI.OpenAI` in the source generator to eliminate unnecessary package dependencies. Migration guide:
     - ➡️ Use `ToOpenAIFunctionDefinition()` extension from `DevGpt.OpenAI` for generating `FunctionDefinition` from `DevGpt.Core.FunctionContract`.
     - ➡️ Use `FunctionContract` for metadata such as function name or parameters.

2. **Namespace Renaming for DevGpt.WebAPI** ([#3152](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3152))
   - ✏️ Renamed the namespace of `DevGpt.WebAPI` from `DevGpt.Service` to `DevGpt.WebAPI` to maintain consistency with the project name.

3. **Semantic Kernel Version Update** ([#3118](https://github.com/khulnasoft/devgpt/issues/3118))
   - 📈 Upgraded the Semantic Kernel version to 1.15.1 for enhanced functionality and performance improvements. This might introduce break change for those who use a lower-version semantic kernel.

## 📚 Documentation
